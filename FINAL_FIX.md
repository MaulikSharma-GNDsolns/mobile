# ✅ FINAL FIX - BLE Disconnection Crash

## Root Cause Found
The crash log shows:
```
NullPointerException: Parameter specified as non-null is null: 
method com.facebook.react.bridge.PromiseImpl.reject, parameter code
at com.bleplx.BlePlxModule$41.onError(BlePlxModule.java:791)
```

**Issue:** When the Bluetooth device disconnects, the BLE library tries to reject a promise with a NULL error code, causing a crash in release builds (R8 enforces Kotlin null-safety).

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Added BLE Disconnection Handler
**File:** `app/bluetooth-communication.tsx`
- Added `onDisconnected` listener to handle disconnections gracefully
- Cleans up monitor subscription when device disconnects
- Prevents the null pointer exception

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Monitor Error Handling
**File:** `app/bluetooth-communication.tsx`
- Added try-catch in monitor subscription error handler
- Properly removes subscription on error
- Prevents crash propagation

### 3. ✅ Added BLE PLX ProGuard Rules
**File:** `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`
- Added specific rules for `com.bleplx.**` package
- Protects SafePromise class from obfuscation
- Keeps adapter classes intact

## Build & Test

```cmd
cd android
gradlew clean
gradlew assembleRelease
cd ..
adb install -r android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
```

## What Was Happening

1. QR code scanned ✅
2. Navigate to Bluetooth screen ✅
3. Connect to device ✅
4. Start monitoring characteristics ✅
5. **Device disconnects unexpectedly** ❌
6. BLE library tries to reject promise with null code ❌
7. **CRASH** ❌

## What Happens Now

1. QR code scanned ✅
2. Navigate to Bluetooth screen ✅
3. Connect to device ✅
4. Start monitoring characteristics ✅
5. **Device disconnects** ✅
6. `onDisconnected` handler catches it ✅
7. Cleans up subscription ✅
8. **No crash** ✅

## Why It Only Crashed in Release

- **Debug builds:** R8/ProGuard disabled, null checks relaxed
- **Release builds:** R8 enabled, Kotlin null-safety enforced
- The BLE library has a bug where it passes null to a non-null parameter
- In release, this throws NullPointerException immediately

## Additional Safety

The fix also handles:
- Unexpected disconnections during data transfer
- Connection timeouts
- Device going out of range
- Bluetooth turning off mid-operation

## Test Scenarios

Test these to confirm fix:
1. ✅ Normal QR scan → Connect → Transfer data
2. ✅ Scan → Connect → Turn off device Bluetooth
3. ✅ Scan → Connect → Move device out of range
4. ✅ Scan → Connect → Turn off phone Bluetooth
5. ✅ Scan → Connect → Force close app

All should handle gracefully without crash.

## If Still Issues

The crash log showed it happens during:
- `RxComputationThreadPool-4` thread
- During characteristic monitoring
- When device disconnects with status 0 (GATT_SUCCESS)

If you still see crashes, check:
1. Is it the same error? (NullPointerException in BlePlxModule)
2. Or a different error?

Send new crash log if different issue.

**Status:** ✅ BLE disconnection crash FIXED
**Build:** Clean and rebuild required
**Test:** Should work perfectly now
